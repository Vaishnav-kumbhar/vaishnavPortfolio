      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        I'm <b>Vaishnav Kumbhar</b>, a passionate Full Stack Developer with a
        BCA from <b>RITEE College of Management, Raipur</b>. I specialize in
        building scalable web applications, interactive games, and delivering
        end-to-end solutions with modern technologies.
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
        I began my professional journey with a <b>6-month internship</b> at
        <b> AB&Kalp Pvt. Ltd</b>, followed by a <b>3-month probation period</b>.
        During this time, I independently developed multiple real-world
        projects, including games and web applications. While seniors guided me
        with approaches and helped identify bugs, the complete development work
        was handled by me, which gave me strong exposure to frontend, backend,
        and payment system integrations.
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
        In <b>February 2025</b>, I joined <b>Kloudeva LLC Pvt. Ltd</b> as a Full
        Stack Developer, where I worked as the <b>sole engineer</b>. I was fully
        responsible for designing, developing, and deploying complete full-stack
        projects. From frontend UI/UX development to backend APIs and database
        design, I independently managed the entire product lifecycle until I
        completed my tenure in <b>August 2025</b>.
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
        With extensive hands-on experience working independently and taking full
        ownership of projects, I bring strong problem-solving abilities,
        adaptability, and accountability to every project. I thrive in
        challenges and aim to create impactful digital solutions.
